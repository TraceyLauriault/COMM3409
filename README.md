# Course Description

> The collection of data about us generally starts when we are born, (sometimes earlier – consider the example of ultrasound), and then continues throughout the course of our lives. Data about us are collected when we go to school and then enter the labour force. We are also tracked throughout our lives via the unique identifier of a Social Insurance Number. Data are also produced as we go about our ordinary daily activities – when we shop, bank, make phone calls, order a taxi, use social media, navigate the city, vote, exercise, and file taxes. Data are also collected as we do exceptional things such as cross international borders, check into hospital, when we commit infractions, at death and even afterward depending on what happens to our bodies, how our families and friends commemorate and remember us and if our actions are recorded and archived. We are datafied, living a dataless life is nearly impossible as is ‘living below the radar’, we each have a data double that leaves behind a data shadow.

> In this course we will examine what the data generated by and about us do, how they are used, who owns them, and if and when linked, filtered through algorithms, search engines or visualized into maps, how they determine actions and material outcomes.

> The course covers a wide range of topics, themes and concepts such as data infrastructures, smart cities, the internet of things (IoT), surveillance and sousveillance, social physics, algorithmic governance, predictive policing,the quantified self, location based services, data collection devices and geodemographics among many others.

# Course Objectives
The objectives of this course are to learn to:

* distinguish big data from small data, and know about types of data;

* conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, as a form of discourse and as media;

* recognize the interconnections between data, their infrastructures, collection and dissemination technologies, software, platforms and forms and how these influence how data are produced and are used;

* identify data politics and critically read data polities; and
* think about data-based knowledge, the construction of facts and the framing of the truth.

## Short Assigments
(5 X 10%=50%), due by noon on the Thursday before class as per the schedule below:

**Pick 5 out of the 10–ONE to THREE page** assignments each are worth 10 marks.  Include the following in the document header: 

> Big Data and Society, COMM 3409A, Submitted to: Dr. Tracey P. Lauriault, Assignment #, dd/mm/yyyy, First and Last Name, Student ID

Assignments involve a data based exercise related to a given week’s topics and readings. These provide you with hands on experience: in searching for data; discovering data sources; reading metadata; documenting processes; with methods to critically think about issues and begin to uncover the techno-politics hidden in technological documents, algorithms, data collection technologies, infrastructures and platforms. Classroom discussions will be informed by discoveries and issues encountered when doing the assignments. Assignments will also provide you with the necessary tools and skills to write the paper.

**Assignments will only be considered submitted for grading once uploaded to cuLearn and the submission statement is accepted.** Under ordinary circumstances, assignments will not be accepted in hard copy or by email. See the Schedule below. 

## Final Essay (20% essay + 5% proposal):
There are two parts to the paper.
1. **Final Essay** (20% **due Monday Dec. 7** just before exams): It is a **short - 16 page MAX essay, including references and the cover page.** The essay will be a critical reading of one or more datasets or databases of your choice.  Along with a description of the dataset/database including things such as its intended use, description, institutional owners and etc., the essay should include information and a discussion if warranted about collection technologies, methodologies, dissemination platforms, portals, infrastructures, sources and so on. Paper topics, issues, or concepts wherever possible should stem from course readings and/or classroom lectures and datasets should be selected keeping that in mind. The assignments, lectures, readings and classroom discussions will provide you with the material required to write the essay.

Include the following on the title page:
> Big Data and Society COMM 3409A
> Final Paper
> Title
> Author: First and Last Name
> Student ID
> Submitted to: Dr. Tracey P. Lauriault
> Date: dd/mm/yyyy

**The paper will only be considered submitted for grading once uploaded to cuLearn and the submission statement is accepted and after the proposal has been submitted and evaluated.** Under ordinary circumstances, essays will not be accepted in hard copy or by email. 

2. **Final Essay Proposal (5% due Week 7: Oct.15):** This is compulsory, and will be marked with comments and suggestions by **Week 8** just before study break. _You can of course do this earlier!_ This should include a tentative title, the topics you wish to examine, why this important or significant and is of interest to you. Ensure to have the name and the source of the dataset/database (s) you would like to study, point out how it relates to what you wish to discuss, include a list of related topics/issues/concepts you might discuss and/or use to support your argument, and a preliminary bibliography. You can do this as a summary, as an abstract, or a table of contents with bullet point notes.  This should be no longer than 2 pages.  

### Assignment & Paper Guidelines:

* Upload your assignments & paper in a Microsoft Word .doc or .docx file (you can export to these formats even if you do not own a copy of Microsoft Word)

* Use _12 pt, double-spaced type - essay and single spaced type - assignments in an appropriate font_ (e.g., Times New Roman, Garamond), flush left, with 1-inch margins and indented paragraphs.

* Number the pages of your paper.

* Pick a citation style and be consistent with it.

#### Late Policy:

* Under ordinary circumstances, assignments will not be accepted more than 1 week after the due date. Extensions must be requested _**in advance, in person,**_ and will typically require documentation of an extended illness or other significant disruption to your ability to complete required academic work.

## Final Exam (25%):

The final exam will include a combination of multiple choice questions, short answer questions about concepts, topics, and issues, and one long answer essay question. The university sets the time and location. Please do not make end-of-term travel plans until these exam schedules have been posted. If you miss the exam, you will have to apply for a formal deferral from the Registrar’s Office – there is no guarantee this application will be approved.
